// The two other primitives are null and undefined

// Variables that are declared but not initialized are undefined
// The following variables are undefined:
var name;
var age;
// being undefined means something is empty. It doesn't have a value yet

// null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "Charlie";
currentPlayer = null;   // This could mean he is game over
